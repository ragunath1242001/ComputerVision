# IPCV-FaceFX — Real-time Face Visual Effects

Three compulsory tasks for the final project:

1. **Face Warp** — dynamic forehead bulge that follows the detected face (Haar).
2. **Face Augmentation** — virtual glasses overlay aligned by eye detection; follows head movement.
3. **Motion Tracking & Interaction** — color-based object tracking that live-controls warp strength and glasses scale.
